## Requirements

- React ^19.0.0
- React DOM ^19.0.0
- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { MarketPage, TradingPanel, OrderBook } from "polymarket-ui";

function App() {
  return (
    <MarketPage>
      <TradingPanel />
      <OrderBook />
    </MarketPage>
  );
}
```

## Dark Mode

The SDK comes with built-in dark mode support using Tailwind CSS. To use dark mode in your application:

1. Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider`:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "polymarket-ui";

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

2. Use the dark mode hook in your components:

```jsx
import { useDarkMode } from "polymarket-ui";

function Component() {
  const { isDarkMode, toggleDarkMode } = useDarkMode();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={toggleDarkMode}>{isDarkMode ? "Switch to Light Mode" : "Switch to Dark Mode"}</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The dark mode state is automatically persisted in localStorage and applies the appropriate Tailwind CSS classes (`dark:`) to your components.
